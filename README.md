# California Housing Price Prediction using Neural Networks

## Description

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict California housing prices using a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras. The pipeline includes data preprocessing (such as feature engineering and normalization), training a deep neural network, and evaluating the model’s performance with various metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and R². Additionally, visualizations are generated to track the training progress and error analysis.

## Topics Covered

- Neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Data preprocessing (feature engineering and normalization)
- Hyperparameter tuning and model training
- Model evaluation with MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, R²
- Visualizations of model performance (loss curves, predictions vs. true values)
- Early stopping for model optimization
- Saving and loading trained models

## Files

- `training_history.csv`: CSV file containing the training history, including loss and MAE for each epoch.
- `evaluation_results.txt`: Text file containing evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, R²).
- `trained_model.h5`: Saved model file after training.
- `training_history.png`: A plot showing training and validation loss, as well as MAE over epochs.
- `absolute_error.png`: A plot showing the absolute error of predictions compared to actual values.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using the following:

```bash
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/california-housing-prediction.git
   cd california-housing-prediction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   - **Windows**:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **macOS/Linux**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can run the script to train the model:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will train the neural network model, evaluate its performance, and save the results in the current directory, including:

- Training history (`training_history.csv`)
- Evaluation results (`evaluation_results.txt`)
- Plots of training progress (`training_history.png`) and error analysis (`absolute_error.png`)
- The trained model (`trained_model.h5`)

## Hyperparameters

The following hyperparameters are used in the model:

- `hidden_layers`: List of the number of neurons in each hidden layer (default: `[512, 256, 128]`)
- `activation`: Activation function for each hidden layer (default: `'relu'`)
- `learning_rate`: Learning rate for the Adam optimizer (default: `0.0001`)
- `epochs`: Number of epochs for training (default: `10000`)
- `batch_size`: Batch size for training (default: `16384`)
- `patience`: Patience for early stopping to prevent overfitting (default: `20`)
- `test_size`: Proportion of the data to be used for testing (default: `0.2`)
- `val_size`: Proportion of the training data to be used for validation (default: `0.2`)
- `random_state`: Random seed for reproducibility (default: `42`)

These can be adjusted in the `config` dictionary inside the `train_model.py` script.

## Evaluation Metrics

The model’s performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**

These metrics are calculated on the test data after training is complete and are saved in `evaluation_results.txt`.

## Visualizations

The following plots are generated during the training process:

- **Model Loss (MSE)**: A plot showing the training and validation loss over epochs.
- **Model MAE**: A plot showing the training and validation MAE over epochs.
- **Predictions vs. True Values**: A plot comparing the true housing prices with the predicted values on the test set.
- **Absolute Error**: A plot showing the absolute error between predicted and true values.

These plots are saved as PNG files (`training_history.png` and `absolute_error.png`).
